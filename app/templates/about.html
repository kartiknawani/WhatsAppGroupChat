    Hi, I am a Python Developer with an interest in Data Analytics and am on the
    path of becoming a Data Engineer in the upcoming years. Along with a
    Data-centric mindset, I love to build products involving real-world use
    cases. I know bits and pieces of Web Development without expertise: Flask,
    Fast API, ReactJS, MySQL, Bootstrap, CSS, JS, HTML. I also do open source
    contributions, not in association with any project, but anything which can
    be improved and reporting bug fixes for them.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am currently mastering Data Analytics and hope to get an FTE in 2022 after
    my graduation in B.Tech in IT. Being involved with computers from a very
    young age, along with programming skills, I have a lot of experience as
    technical support for Windows-related issues, installations, and gadgets
    recommendations. In my free time, I do video editing and writing both
    technical and nontechnical articles.
    <br />
    <br />
    I have written over 140+ articles for companies as a freelancer, blogs for
    my website, and medium blogs for publications. I usually listen to music
    while working. Do check out my projects on GitHub and if they are good
    enough, support me by starring and sharing themðŸ˜ƒ Thanks!
  </p>
